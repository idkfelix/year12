# Audience
My target audience is VCE 
# Genre & Style
My media product will be a coming of age drama narrative in the form of a printed zine. I've seen these genres produced in media products the follow a similar theme / style to my narrative on a minimal budget, hence I have found it to be the most appropriate path to follow in the production of my zine. These genres often stylistically are a product of their minimal budget, using old hardware with 3CCD sensors that add a level of grain and imperfection to the final image, for my zine I will opt to use 35mm film to recreate this effect through photography to provide authentic imperfection to the final product. Using this film for my photography will additionally provide a stylistic colour profile produced in the camera. 

The coming of age genre features a narrative that primarily focuses on the growth and maturing of the protagonist and emphasises discussion and relationships between characters over action and suspense typical of most genres. These tropes inherently tie into the drama genre containing tropes of fictional sensationalised relationships and disagreements between the narratives characters. Between these genres they share various common tropes such as; the use of lighting and colour grading to promote emphasis of emotion in pivotal scenes, sudden key change in the protagonists life and (anti) happily ever after endings.
