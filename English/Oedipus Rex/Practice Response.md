A key theme of Sophocles renowned Greek play, Oedipus Rex, is the different ways characters respond to and act in reoccurring times of crises. This variety in actions from the people of Thebes is used by Sophocles to highlight fatal flaws in their character as a cautionary tale to the audience of their repercussions.

The most striking of these flaws comes from the dichotomy between Oedipus and Jocasta in their reaction to the prophecy. Sophocles persistently represents Oedipus throughout the play as a well intentioned noble man the suffers from an excessive pride or hubris that ultimately leads to his demise. This is seen in the common trope of arrogance as Oedipus, after solving the riddle of the Sphinx, begins to perceive himself as a demigod, proclaiming "You pray to the gods, let me grant your prayers" to the people of Thebes. Additionally Oedipus is compelled throughout the play to seek out the truth of king Laius' untimely murder despite his underlying knowledge that its likely to result of his own wrongdoings, confiding he has "a terrible fear the blind seer can see" after being confronted by Tiresias about his involvement with the death.
