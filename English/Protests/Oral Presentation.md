- Public misunderstanding of AI and how its effecting them
	- [Only 2 in 5 Australians](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:00d3c94) recognise themselves as having an understanding of AI and use cases, compared to the 4 in 5 average of other countries in the Australasia region. \[University of Queensland 2023]
	- [7 News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsPtyuwwLuo) attributes the 'superpower of AI' to explain a recent cyber attack on PTV Myki cards.
		- Debunking the use of AI with luhn algorithm and simple brute force.
		- Perpetuates the public mistrust of artificial intelligence
		- Is being used as a scapegoat due to its lack of general understanding 
- AI will not continue to grow exponentially as advertised to consumers
	- Industry leaders such as polarising owner of Tesla, Elon Musk, have been vocal about predictions that AGI will be achieved by 2029, this has driven the race to adopt AI
	- Moore's law, theory from intel co-founder of transistor density and processing power doubling every year
		- has been disprove over the past decade as physical limits have been reached, even acknowledged of its sustainability
		- additionally this hardware is used to power AI and it has seen a great decrease in rate of computational advancement.
	- [Renowned study published by Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325) concluded the that the speculated achievement of AGI would ultimately require 5 to 6 orders of magnitude more training data than currently exists and the current supply would be exhausted at latest by 2027.
