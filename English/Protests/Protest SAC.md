The 1978 Sydney Mardi Gras stands as historic moment is Australian history, proving the power of protest in shaping democracy, echoing Howard Zinn's assertion that "Protest beyond the law is not a departure from democracy; its is absolutely essential to it." The march, the first of its kind nationwide, has become a historic event for not only the LGBTQ community, but all Australians as its promotion of protest in the face of authority has forever changed the way we view and protest for change in modern Australia.

The 1978 Sydney Mardi Gras was a march and parade was organised in solidarity with similar communities around the world on the anniversary of the 1969 stonewall riots in New York to advocate for the rights and recognition of the cities growing LGBTQ community amidst a time in which they faced great prejudice. The parade led down busy Sydney streets as thousands of participants marched, preaching their message, only to be met with police barricades and ultimately, a violent ambush resulting in the arrest of 53 participants and the brutal bashing of countless more in retaliation to their protest. The aftermath of the ordeal saw the Sydney Morning Herald publish the identities of those arrested, causing many to loose their jobs, be outed to their families or even sadly take their own life out of shame. This sparked further outrage within the community leading to the "Drop the Charges" protests against the prosecutors leading to the arrests of another 129 participants.

Through the tireless efforts of pro-bono lawyers, all charges were dropped against the protestors with the courts ruling that police had acted "unlawfully" during their operation. Moreover, the high-profile case prompted the reassessment of laws surrounding public demonstrations and protests around the country. These results have shifted public perception of protestors as the "78ers" proved with their stand against the law that the democratic system will prevail, enticing similar marginalised groups to make a stand. The annual Sydney Mardi Gras, now an endorsed event, serves as a testament to their enduring impact

The significance of the 1978 Sydney Mardi Gras has forever left a mark on Australia, as the "78ers" stand has transformed opinion and law of not only the LGBTQ community, enacting immense change, but also the way we see and protest nationwide. Despite the perceived injustices that they committed at the time, the 1978 Mardi Gras protestors have ultimately laid the groundwork for all Australians to exercise their rights to protest and push their cause. However these acts of protest that led to these protections are often forgotten as modern protestors fail to reflect on the "78ers" change was a result of protesting "beyond the law" to "insight democracy" for their cause.
