Many of the public's first exposure to the concept of artificial intelligence has been through its portrayal in science fiction media where it is depicted in a form known as artificial general intelligence or AGI. This AI is capable of comprehending complex concepts and forming independent thoughts, achieving this advancement is widely considered to be the end goal of AI development. Many leaders in the field, such as polarising CEO of Tesla an ex-partner in OpenAI, have been extremely vocal of their predicted timelines to achieve AGI as soon as 2029, citing speculation of artificial intelligence future exponential growth following rapid advancement over the last decade. This speculation has caused a modern gold rush of adopting and investing in the latest AI technologies so to not be left behind, however recent research and the trends of similar past phenomenons have shown with a high degree of certainty that current methods of development cannot achieve AGI, moreover cannot even reasonably sustain its current rate of growth. A renowned phenomenon observed by and named after Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore, stated  'The number of transistors in an integrated circuit, \[or computer chip], will double every year,'  due to a historical trend of transistor size reduction. This was later revised to every two years, from which its projection remained true for many years, however
