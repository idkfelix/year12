# Audience Feedback
## Is the narrative coherent?
> I think your narrative and the storyline's progression is relatively clear, but the act annotations would make it easier for audiences to understand.

> It’s really clear - especially laid out in order like they were, I didn’t have any trouble understanding the narrative.

> Yes, it makes a lot of sense viewing it like this and I think that you’ve done a great job adhering to your narrative statement that you described.

> It's clear that the protagonist gets obsessed with skateboarding and is doing all he can to improve, just not entirely sure if it's clear that it's an obsession, maybe if you made it clear that he's ignoring his friend by showing that there's a ton of missed notifications or something along those lines, again that's up to you.

> The narrative is recognizable, although it would probably be a lot better once there are the annotations. The change in the outfit is an interesting element.

> For a collection of photos, I think it clearly and coherently show's us your narrative in a way that's easy to follow.

> I understand that a guy goes into a store, buys a skateboard, does some tricks and injuries himself. I think if you want to make it his obsessiveness with skateboard maybe implement a few photos that explain that. Like the phone photo could have a bunch of messages missed or something like that

> It was clear after you told the narrative but without that information it is a bit unclear - so the annotations you mentioned would be added hopefully will help with that.

> For the most part its pretty coherent, its a bit unclear that he is neglecting his friends. maybe more shots of him receiving notifications and ignoring it.

> Sort of?? It's not really that clear, but the images link together if that makes sense. Your story is shown, but you need an in-depth explanation of what is happening.
## Are there improvements that could be made by cropping any photos?
>No. They all are laid out fine, I can't remember if there are any specifically that need to be changed just mostly making sure the key elements take up most of the photo.

>Cropping could bring more emphasis on the phone but otherwise idk.

> To be honest I don't think that you should crop any photos because at the moment it has an early 2000s feeling and I think that the composition aids to that. If you really want to crop something maybe consider using the rule of thirds for a more aesthetic shot but up to you. Again, I don't think it needs any.

> I'm not really sure I think the images work fine the way they are.

> Overall, I think that the photos don't necessarily need any cropping, but if you did decide to crop some of the background out it wouldn't take away from the final photos.

> I think some of them could be cropped closer to the figure, like removing some of the trees and unnecessary background elements.

> I don’t think much cropping is needed. I like the negative space in some of the photos, but (unless it’s not what you are going for) I think that you could crop some of the photos so that there is more of a focus on the character, especially when he becomes obsessed, so that it appears that he has got that extra kind of tunnel vision.

> I'm unsure tbh on how you could improve. Nothing really stuck out to me where improvement could be made, I think you've done a lot well all around. (I'm also not a photography genius so I don't have the greatest eye for criticism in this sense)

> A feel if you want to take away some photos, you could take  away the one or two that were doing the tricks. But that is if you want to take some away, I believe that the amount of photos are fine.

> Depending on how you present it you might want to crop so that the subject is bigger, I had to really get close and squint to notice some things. But if you intend to present in a way where the audience can pick it up and bring it close to them then I don’t think it is a problem.
## Are there any further improvements I could make?
>Just making sure your narrative is clear (unless you want it to be unclear) and maybe make the images a bit bigger, I know printing photos makes awkward sizes but they're just a bit small. Overall, the style of the images is really cool, but the narrative is a bit unclear, and the details (like the messaging) get lost. The idea is really cool though!

> More focus on the neglecting everything else, maybe shots of him ignoring people.

> Maybe you could do some colour grading because the warm lighting of the shop is very much contrasted by the cold lighting of the light. Up to you with if you want that contrast but personally I'd try and balance it out.

> Maybe some trials with editing the lighting or adding filters to see if it will help boost the images. Could try and make the screen lighter on the phone through this so it is easier to see what is on the phone.

> I think making it more obvious that the protagonist is ignoring his friends/other aspects of his life would make the obsession clearer for audiences who don't previously know the narrative outline. Other than that, I think it's good!

> All the suggestions that I would have made would work out with the method of exhibition that you described, so no I think its great

> Once again, I think there's a lot done right with your photo's. I think they came out well, tell a clear narrative, and catch a certain vibe/aesthetic that remains consistent throughout. There might be some nitty gritty stuff that could be improved on but there was nothing that was overly noticeable for me that could be Improved on.

> I think the things I have said above are apart of the general feedback, maybe make it seems like he is isolating away from his friends, because it doesn’t really seem like he is addicted or obsessed as you stated in the main idea o the photos.

> If you wanted to keep it more concise you could remove one of the shots of lying on the ground with the broken skateboard. Unless I'm missing something it makes me question why there are two shots of the same thing which might distract from your original intention.

> Maybe elaborate a bit more on the narrative with the images alone, otherwise the images look pretty good, and the story is coherent.
