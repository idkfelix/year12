## Evaluation Strategy
To evaluate my software solution I will create create various criteria tables for myself, the client and user testing participants, corresponding to the the chosen development model's efficiency and effectiveness in production, the implementation's usability within its intended environment, and its satisfaction of the clients functional and non-functional requirements. 

This evaluation will be conducted over two weeks in individual sessions with the user participants to document user satisfaction and a meeting with the client to discuss the outcome of the project and the satisfactory completion of its requirements. Additionally I will separately conduct further evaluation of the software and its development model to document its practical efficiency and effectiveness.
## User Satisfaction
*The following user satisfaction data was collected from three user testing participants of varying levels of technical literacy, labelled 'amateur', 'novice' and 'advanced', after the completion of their testing as surveys regarding the solutions application in a production environment are not viable given the projects context*

| User     | Satisfaction | Feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Amateur  | 7            | The Notelass has a nice design and worked fine once i was logged in but the way of logging in wasn't very easy and the Maths stuff in notes didn't make much sense but I wouldn't personally use it anyways.                                                                           |
| Novice   | 9            | I couldn't figure out the sign in, but I'm sure that can be fixed with some instructions. The actual note taking was super familiar to what I currently use and the integration with Compass was very useful.                                                                          |
| Advanced | 8            | The websites session id login works great as a way to protect user credentials, the integration for compass is seamless and everything loads very fast. I appreciate the support for markdown and LaTeX in notes, but i wish there was some form of key-binds to speed up my workflow. |
| **Mean** | 8            | -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
