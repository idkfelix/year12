## Development Model
The development model I chose for this project consisted of a traditional waterfall model with nested sprints in the design and development stages of the waterfall. This project effectively required the use of a waterfall model to meet assessment dates not possible with a spiral or agile development model due to their core focus on iterative design. The use of this model did suffer restrictions regarding the modification of project scope or requirements as waterfall development features large amounts of planning in the initial evaluation to boost efficiency throughout the project, however due to the fast changing nature of modern software development this proved counter productive throughout the development of my software solution as the clients requirements changed. Thankfully the proactive implementation of sprints throughout the design and development stages, split into three scopes of implementation identified in the initial client meetings, allowed for the required reduction in scope to the project by removing sprints, albeit still creating large unplanned modifications to the production timeline. 

Reflecting on this pitfall of the development model it can be seen the potential loss in effectiveness as the client received a software solution missing proposed requirements as a result of the reducing nature of the waterfall model, compared to the spiral development model that would be better suited to a project of this type as the scope expands throughout the project, allowing for more effective planning leading to an overall gain in efficiency, rivalling that of the waterfall model in perfect conditions.

Although a great deal of time was lost in redundant planning and adjustments to the project throughout the design and development stages, having the project clearly planned out from the initial proposal and only removing tasks from the project plan proved to benefit efficiency in the later stages of development as their related tasks could be easily anticipated and allocated a suitable time frame for complet
