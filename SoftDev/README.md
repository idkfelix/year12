# VCE Software Dev 3+4
This repo contains all of the work and assessments I have completed throughout VCE Applied Computing: Software Development 3+4 attended through Virtual School Victoria. All content is written in markdown syntax for use with obsidian.md or any other markdown editor and exported as PDF files for submission. All media is saved under the folder /\_media and referenced with obsidian's wiki links format, this may not work with your preferred markdown editor.
