An opinion piece written and published recently by Julie Cross, an editor at News Corp Australia, discusses the contentious issue of social media regulation for young teens around the country. Cross argues this in an attempt to gather support for newly proposed legislation at state and federal levels regarding a change to the minimum age requirements for Australian users on social media platforms from thirteen to sixteen. To convey this contention Cross presents an introduction to the issue, to highlight the urgency of the issue, followed by an argumentative approach which adopts an analytical set of techniques that draw on experts, present evidence and recall anecdote. Moreover in combination with her strategic and harrowing tonal shifts, Cross builds a set of arguments that present an irrefutable stance on the issue.
