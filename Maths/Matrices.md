## Terms
- Order - The length of $m$ (rows) and 
## Addition & Subtraction
- To perform addition or subtraction all matrices must have the same order
## Multiplication
- Scalar
	- Resulting matrix is the product of each element of input matrix with a single number
	- $2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 &  2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$
## Transposing
- The transpose of a matrix, $A$, is denoted $A^T$
- A transposed matrix has the same elements just with rows and columns swapped
- If matrix $A$ has an order of $m\cdot{n}$, then $A^T$ has an order of $n\cdot{m}$
- Bottom row transposes to far right, vice versa
