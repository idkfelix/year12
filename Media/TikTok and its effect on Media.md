# Introduction

# Traditional Media
Historically media has been a finite source of content for audiences to receive information, news and messages from producers through early methods of communication such as newsprint, radio, film and television, all defining features of the broadcast era. This era represents the time before widespread popularity and access to the Internet over highspeed connections capable of transferring the large amounts of data that make up todays media landscape. 

Named after the technology of the time following the invention of modern broadcasting equipment, media access in the broadcast era became some of the first widely available low latency information transfer the world had seen. This was quickly adopted by production studios to capture large shares of the market divided into sections of the then limited transmission wavelength frequencies.
## Audience Relationships
Although widely available, consumer equipment of the time still came with a hefty price tag, creating a barrier to entry for consumers to view media and with an even higher cost,  a giant barrier to entry for producers and production companies of the time to setup studios capable of transmitting to audiences. This led to a dynamic of trust been formed between producers and audiences, who had no ability to share their own and had very little to no say in the content being published, over the authenticity of information being put out by producers. Moreover producers had to monetize their productions by offering advertising slots in between scheduled programming, partners in which would hold these producers accountable to keeping their content in the best interest of the viewer or audience. 

## Anti-Competition
Part of this one way relationship between producers and audiences of the time came it part from the monopolisation and anti-competitive practices production companies and media organisations utilised during the traditional broadcast era. This came in the form of local and state level broadcasters holding licences to large sections of transmission frequencies, allowing them to push social and political messages to the population of the region with little debate or contest due to the limited discussion accessible for audiences to converse critically of promoted ideals within published media. Additionally small producers creating media promoting emerging views with little investment or capital funding were often pushed out of the industry by large organisations.
## Regulation
Traditionally governments and regulating bodies have had a great deal of oversight in the production of media in order to protect the interests of audiences and hold production companies and media organisations accountable to the content they publish. This regulation has been harsh with large fines and penalties handed out to producers to punish and prevent the spread of misinformation, harmful content or messaging deemed dangerous under newly created legislation. Historically these measures have proved effective in the regulation of media throughout the broadcast era, although never definitively combatting anti-competitive practices of the time.

# The Advent of TikTok
As the media landscape has transitioned from traditional forms of media and industry structure to that of the modern web 2.0 a key change in the way media is consumed and produced has come around from the dot com boom in the form of social media websites and services. These platforms have allowed users to create, share and discuss media at little to no cost on widely available and cheaply produced hardware, leading to a huge influx of fresh content available across the internet, promoting a shift in the way audiences interact with producers and posing concerning issues to the way regulators effectively oversee the publication of media.

One of the biggest social media platforms, only being released globally in 2019, is TikTok, an app produced by the Chinese internet giant ByteDance. TikTok is
