- **Types of Software**
	- Systems software: an operating system or device driver
	- Programming software: tools for writing software, IDE, GCC, etc.
	- Applications: programs / websites which help users complete tasks
	- Embedded Software: used to control machines and devices
- **Reasons for Development**
	- Custom software: created to meet the specific needs of a user
	- Commercial & OSS: made to meet a broad set of *perceived* needs of potential users
	- Personal: created to automate mundane tasks or entertainment or educational purposes

## Organisations
- **Goals**: used by organisations to state long term intentions or purposes
- **Objectives**: define shorter term measurable actions or tasks that contribute to these set goals

- Organisations must decide **which types of software are required** to support the business based on many factors:
	- If generic commercial / OSS will cover their use case?
	- Must custom software be developed for their requirements?
	- Does the chosen software sufficiently meet their security standards?
	
- Use of software can **enhance business processes** by:
	- improving productivity through increased efficiency and quality
	- managing information to enhance decision making 
	- cost reduction by improving efficiency and automating processes
	- facilitating collaboration with remote teams
	- accelerating growth by enabling innovation and integration 
	- improving sales and customer service
	- increasing engagement and communication with customers
## Data Integrity
- Data integrity relates to data being **Valid, Accurate and Consistent**
- Has two different meanings
	- As a **state** defines a data set that is both valid and accurate
	- As a **process** it describes measures used to ensure validity and accuracy of a data set.
	
- **Validation** checks that the correct type of data is entered
- **Verification** checks the data is actually what you require 
- **Accuracy**: accurate data is correct and complete
- **Correctness**: information that matches its real world representation
- **Completeness**: every part of the data is recorded, critical to decision making
- **Appropriateness**: data that can be accessed with reasonable restrictions
- **Relevance**: the stored data is relevant to those collecting it
- **Timeliness**: data is accessible and available as required.   
- **Consistency**: multiple sources of the same data should match up 
- **Validity**: data that is formatted correctly and is usable by those accessing it
- **Uniqueness**: a data sources assurance against unintended duplicate records.
- **Accessibility**: users that need the data can access it

- **Secure Information** process characteristics
	- **Protected**: user authentication, passwords, firewalls, anti-malware and physical protections should be in place to restrict access to data.
	- **Confidential**:
