In the process of developing my project for the client from the design to a fully functional website various compromises on the websites functionality had to be altered to ensure the best user experience. The main compromise that was discussed with the client is routing requests from the client to the compass API through the websites server rather than have everything be a direct request from the client. This change was made to allow for SSR (server side rendering) to be implemented to give the end user a smoother experience with Notelass in addition to also giving the project the ability to best comply the compass API cross site request policy.
