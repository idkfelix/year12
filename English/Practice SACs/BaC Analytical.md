## Essay
"Born a Crime", a memoir by renound South African comedian Trevor Noah, explores his childhood living in Johannesburg as a mixed race child during apartheid. The theme of victimhood is echoed throughout the text as Noah discusses his family as "Victims of apartheid" and how he never "[saw] life that way". This idea is explored through his experiences with police, other races and 

Trevor Noah's memoir "Born a Crime" conveys and discusses his families experiences with racism from authority and other disadvantaged races during their time living under apartheid in South Africa. Noah explores the idea of his families suffrage due to the extreme racial prejudice that they faced from every level of the authoritative government through experiences as a young child. Labelling himself "Born a Crime" Noah recognises his conception as the birth place of a life running from apartheid, coming from the top level of government Noah opens his memoir with the "Immorality Act" to convey his and his families immediate suffrage from the racially prejudice system to the reader, making them realise the scale of his victimhood. Noah expands on this later in his memoir by reliving his memories leaving the house with a white woman posing as his mother to avoid the imminent danger of being re-homed as a mixed race child if caught by police. These experiences indicate Noah's attitude to authority during apartheid, expressing himself from a victim of the brutal police tactics to a immoral being in the eyes of the law. Noah further discusses his racial suffrage from those of different races that have been similarly discriminated against. One of the most striking stories shared by Noah to reinforce these ideas is his experience nearing being kidnapped with his mother by a cab driver from a different tribe. Noah discusses this experience in a contrasting fashion to that of his experience with the law as he recognises that his mothers resilience to the prejudice saves them from their approaching fate. This idea of social racism is expressed differently to that of systemic racism throughout his memoir, Noah accepts his suffrage to the authorities prejudice, however he finds his and his families values and resilience allow them to not fall victim to that imposed by their community.
