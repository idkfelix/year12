> I would be blind to misery not to pity my people kneeling at my feet

> Blind as you are, you can feel all the more what sickness haunts our city

> You’ve lost your power, stone-blind, stone-deaf—senses, eyes blind as stone!

> this fortune-teller peddling lies, eyes peeled for his own profit—seer blind in his craft!

> you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this. You with your precious eyes, you’re blind to the corruption of your life

>Blind who now has eyes, beggar who now is rich, he will grope his way toward a foreign soil, a stick tapping before him step by step.
