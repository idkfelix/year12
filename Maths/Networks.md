# Basics
- **Vertex**: an object represented by a point on the graph
- **Edge**: an edge is a connection between two vertices represented by a line
- **Loop**: a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself
- **Graph**: a graph is a collection of vertices that may be connected to each other using edges is a specific way
- **Degree**: the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to itself. A *loop* counts as 2 edges for the degree of the vertex
