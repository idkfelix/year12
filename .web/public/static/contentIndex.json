(Hint: connect this to an excerpt from Chapter 9 - “All you had to do was denounce your people, denounce your history, and leave your darker-skinned friends and family behind”. P.119)\n\n\n8. Explain how Part I of Noah’s romantic trilogy can be described as both ironic and a symbol.\n\nChapter 11: Prelude\n\n9. In this prelude, Noah shares quite a tragic story of growing up so poor that his mum would turn off the car and make him push it to school to save petrol. How does Noah make this information palatable for his readers? Provide two examples to support your answer.\n\nChapter 11: Outsider\n\n10. Read the following excerpt in which Noah describes the cliques and groups that formed during lunch break at his high school, Sandringham High:\n\n   &gt; South African schools don’t have cafeterias. At Sandringham we’d buy our lunch at what we call the tuck shop, a little canteen, and then have free rein to go wherever we wanted on the school grounds to eat—the quad, the courtyard, the playground, wherever. Kids would break off and cluster into their cliques and groups. People were still grouped by colour in most cases, but you could see how they all blended and shaded into one another. The kids who played soccer were mostly black. The kids who played tennis were mostly white. The kids who played cricket were a mix. The Chinese kids would hang out next to the prefab buildings. The matrics, what South Africans call seniors, would hang out on the quad. The popular, pretty girls would hang out over here, and computer geeks would hang out over there. To the extent that the groupings were racial, it was because of the ways race overlapped class and geography out in the real world. Suburban kids hung out with suburban kids. Township kids hung out with township kids.\n   &gt;\n\nWhat similarities or differences have you observed during lunchtime at Mullauna College?\n\n\n\nEver the outsider, I created my own strange little world. What world did Noah create and how did this operate?\n\n\n\n12. In Chapter 4 we learned that Noah used language and “became a chameleon” to change people’s “perception” of his colour”. Discuss what other tools Noah used at Sandringham High School to become “a cultural chameleon.”\n\n\n13. Noah often clarifies South African practices or concepts by comparing them to American references and some of his humour is clearly for an American audience. Find three examples of this from this chapter.\n\nChapter 12: Prelude\n\n14. Why is Noah “consumed with regret for the things he didn’t do?”\n\nChapter 12: A Young man’s Long, Awkward, Occasionally Tragic, and Frequently Humiliating Education in Affairs of the Heart, Part II: The Crush\n\n15. Why doesn’t Noah ever ask out his high school crush, Zaheer and what does this experience teach him?\n\nChapter 13: Prelude\n\n\nRead the prelude to Chapter 13 and explain a couple of things that resonate with you (for example, they might be interesting, relatable/unrelatable, or poignant).\n\n\nChapter 13: Colour-blind\n\n17. Noah describes he and his friend Teddy as thick as thieves and recalls how together they begin committing petty crimes, such as breaking windows and stealing chocolates from a stationary shop.\na) What are your thoughts about Noah’s early criminal acts?\n\n\nb) When Teddy was caught, should Noah have admitted his guilt as well? Why/Why not?\n\n\n18. Read the following excerpt from the end of this chapter:\n\n  &gt; I kept waiting for it to be a trick, for them to turn and say, “It’s you!” They didn’t. At a certain point, I felt so invisible I almost wanted to take credit. I wanted to jump up and point at the TV and say, “Are you people blind?! That’s me! Can you not see that that’s me?!” But of course I didn’t. And they couldn’t. These people had been so fucked by their own construct of race that they could not see that the white person they were looking for was sitting right in front of them.\n  &gt;\n  &gt;  Eventually they sent me back to class. I spent the rest of the day and the next couple of weeks waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for my mum to get the call. “We’ve got him! We figured it out!” But the call never came.\n  &gt;\n\nExplain what Noah means by “their own construct of race”.\n\nChapter 14: A Young man’s Long, Awkward, Occasionally Tragic, and Frequently Humiliating Education in Affairs of the Heart, Part III: The Dance\n\n\nIn what way does Noah’s experience with Babiki symbolise his hubris?\n\n\n\n20. How does this experience with Babiki reinforce Noah’s comment in the prelude to Chapter 4, that “Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says, “We’re the same.” A language barrier says, “We’re different.”\n"},"Maths/Data-Analysis":{"title":"Data Analysis","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Terms\n\nPopulation - all of the data\nSample - subset of the population\nElement - term in data\nMeasure of Centre\n\nMedian\nMean\n\n\nMeasure of Spread\n\nStandard Deviation\nInterquartile Range (IQR)\n\n\nMean &amp;

I will conclude my experiment by analysing each photograph and discussing the benefits of the settings used.\nExperiment / Reflection\n\r\nFor my first photograph I set my colour balance to -3, ND filter to off and detail level to 1 which produced a blown out cool colour effect over the whole image, this is especially noticeable when looking at the white tones across the shot, this style of photo looks quite amateur and I will avoid creating this effect in my final product by using the appropriate ND filter setting in bright environments and opting for a more neutral colour balance that can then be manipulated in post-production\r\n\r\nMy camera setup for the second photograph used contrasting settings to the first image by adjusting the ND filter to be set at 1/8, colour balance +3 and detail level to 5. This style of photography is more appealing to me, however the increased sharpness of the image is very harsh and does not suit the aesthetic of zine that I aim to produce. Despite the pitfalls of this setting profile I do like the saturated colour pallet and believe this is suited to my production as I aim to convey emotion through the use of traditional colour techniques.\r\n\r\nMy final photograph was taken with almost neutral camera settings, except for a cooler white balance and ‘detail level’ of 3, this profile offers a cleaner image that can be manipulated in post-production with colour grading techniques. Although this photograph is taken with neutral settings in mind it is important to note that the camera used to take all of my photos uses a 3CCD imaging system that is notorious for producing images with a grainy or dirty look. This choice of camera (Panasonic HVX200) is deliberate as it has been used almost exclusively when producing skateboarding films over the last two decades since its release and after my experimentation I will utilise its distinct style to replicate that familiar look in my final product."},"Media/notes/21-2-24":{"title":"21-2-24","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Basement Scene\nCamera\n\ntilt / high angle\nFrantic handheld\nRunning with camera\n\nActing\n\nDeep breathing\nFurrowed brows\nJolting movements\n\nMise en scene\n\nbrown set to seem welcoming\n1950s furniture references history / being stuck in the past\ncotton foreshadows\npolice / TSA wear blue\n\nEditing\n\nboosted blue tones\nquick cuts\nhigh contrast\nsoft / harsh lighting\n\nLighting\n\nRed highlights\nRose in lowkey lighting to seem threatening\nLights in rods car\nBlue / Red light dichotomy\n\nSound\n\nStriking music\nLong notes\nDiegetic sound\nRoses headphones show cluelessness\nVocal choir in surgery to imply scale\n\nStorylines\n\nCutting between Chris and rod\nRod and Rose interact\nIncreases tension\nConfirms up the the house slaves being the grandparents\n\nCharacter\n\nChris stuck in the basement looking at the TV\nRose major development\nReflects on past memories\n\nSetting\n\nBasement is in warm tones\nsymmetry in the rooms\nOperating Room is cold and dark\n\nNarrative\n\nWalter takes his own life due to the hypnotism\nWalter turns on the family after escaping the mind control\nResolution to family’s whos who\n\nPoint of view\n\nsitting in the chair watching the tv\ndraws attention to the recording on the tv\nflashback pov to the sunken place\nin the glasses of the surgeon (dean) doing the surgery\n\nStructuring of time\n\njump cuts between the scenes of rod when he’s in the police station\ncontrast highlights the severity of the situation\ncontraction of time as rod appears out of nowhere\nflashbacks to the sunken place\nnon-linear structure\n\nIn Class Questions\nExplain how two media codes and/or conventions work together to engage an audience in onw media narrative that you have studied this year?\nThe Basement Scene in Jordan Peele’s film “Get Out” uses a combination of Lighting and Editing to create a striking dichotomy with contrasting colour that represents the characters indoctrination into the mind control plot of the narrative. Throughout the scene Peele uses sharp red and blue tones that traditionally represent evil and darkness contrasting to the cooler tones representing purity and resistance, this creates a dichotomy between the characters who are luring Chris and trying to mind control him highlighted with sharp red lighting contrasting with Chris and Rob almost always being lit with cooler blue lights to show their resistance. These tone fluxuate throughout the scene as Chris is initially being controlled warmer lights and red tones are boosted in post production to represent his indoctrination, the opposite is also true as later in the scene when Chris is escaping blue tones slowly get more prominent as shots flip from warm tones to cooler lighting eventually climaxing in the final shots when Rob comes to rescue Chris and little to no red tones are remaining. These effects are created with the use of diffused coloured bulbs to convey mood whilst still leaving shots with dark contrast, this is used in unison with harsh colour grading to boost vibrant tones and adjust warm tones without having to the cut shots short."},"Media/notes/29-2-24":{"title":"29-2-24","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Get Out Quotes\n\n’That your race is your defining characteristic&#039;\n&#039;That America is still divided by colour and race is still a active part of the cultural landscape&#039;\n&#039;That racial inequality still exists&#039;\n&#039;That discussing racism actually perpetrates it&#039;\n&#039;That racism no longer exists&#039;\n&#039;That the problem of racism has been solved’\n\nChris’ Views &amp; Values\nChris supports the dominant view of racism, recognising when people hold racist values and opposing it, however unlike the the emerging view that promotes taking action against these values Chris’ character opposes confrontation leading him to stay quiet even when he is faced with the harsh environment of the narrative.\nHow Chris is Conveyed\n\nThe use of expressive facial movements and particular body language shows Chris’ unease and scepticism throughout the film when talking to Rose’s family\nMise en scene and specific colour grading are used to subconsciously convey the resistance and contrastingly weak willed actions of Chris throughout the film, this is achieved with cooler and vibrant blue tones that imply the good intention and hero style narrative of the character\n"},"README":{"title":"README","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"              ,---------------------------,\n              |  /---------------------\\  |\n              | |                       | |\n              | |     GitHub.com/       | |\n              | |      idkfelix/        | |\n              | |       year12          | |\n              | |                       | |\n              |  \\_____________________/  |\n              |___________________________|\n            ,---\\_____     []     _______/------,\n          /         /______________\\           /|\n        /___________________________________ /  | ___\n        |                                   |   |    )\n        |  _ _ _                 [-------]  |   |   (\n        |  o o o                 [-------]  |  /    _)_\n        |__________________________________ |/     /  /\n    /-------------------------------------/|      ( )/\n  /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/ /\n/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/ /\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n"},"SoftDev/SAC2/SAC-2-Submission":{"title":"SAC 2 Submission","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"SoftDev/SAT1/Ideas":{"title":"Ideas","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Compass Notes\n\nlogin with compass account for authentication (single account philosophy)\nview lesson plans, learning tasks, resources and schedule\nWYSIWYG markdown editor beartocode.github.io/carta/examples\nLink notes to lesson and class ID\nAI note summarization\nSvelte frontend\nBackend\n\nWrap compass API\nArchive markdown notes to compass files\nAI integration to generate notes summary\nSearch notes by class or for topics\nblob storage for notes in compass tasks\n\n\nFrontend\n\nTailwind and Daisy UI for modern user experience\nUpcoming task tracker/timeline\nTheme switcher\nLogin page\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nStoring all data in compass\nnotes editor\nupcoming learning tasks\n\nprogress check\nkeeping on top of tasks\ncomments on progress\n\n\nextracting tasks from lesson plans\nlinking notes to activity and lesson\ntagging notes with topics\nviewing lesson plan\nrevision\n\ncontext to class notes, lesson plans and VCAA\ngenerate summaries from users notes, topics and lesson plans\nai to create flash cards, practice SAC questions and quiz (short answer and multiple choice), created from notes at different difficulties, (context to previous exams)\n\n\n"},"SoftDev/SAT1/Project-Proposal":{"title":"Project Proposal","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent NameFelix CoulthardStudent SchoolMullauna College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClient’s first nameJoel PorterClient business name (optional)Mullauna College\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground: Description of the client’s business, their activities, and the current processes they use.Joel is the website manager and network admin at Mullauna College, his job consists of handling tickets for network issues, device issues and managing content on the schools website.Opportunity: Description of the solution that the client requires – What is the problem?
