Notelass will be a tool for students at Mullauna College to efficiently and effectively take organised notes for their classes and provide revision tools for students to retain and apply information from their notes. The solution will seamlessly integrate with the schools current online management software, Compass, this will allow students to attach notes to subjects and classes for easy organisation, view class resources within the tool to avoid context switching hindering the users train of thought and store all user generated data within Compass to ensure proper security.
# Client
