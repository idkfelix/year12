If we don't protest we will never see change. This message has been echoed frequently over the last century following the rise of large growth in protests and public demonstrations from marginalised groups pushing to enact change. A standout instance of this push within Australia is the 1978 Sydney Mardi Gras when for the first time in Australian history thousands of the LGBTQ community gathered in the streets of Sydney city as a parade to protest for recognition and rights for their community. This parade was met with harsh backlash from the public and law enforcement at the time but has ultimately led to the furthering of their movement within Australia.
