# In Class Questions
Explain how two media codes and/or conventions work together to engage an audience in onw media narrative that you have studied this year?

The Basement Scene in Jordan Peele's film "Get Out" uses a combination of Lighting and Editing to create a striking dichotomy with contrasting colour that represents the characters indoctrination into the mind control plot of the narrative. Throughout the scene Peele uses sharp red and blue tones that traditionally represent evil and darkness contrasting to the cooler tones representing purity and resistance, this creates a dichotomy between the characters who are luring Chris and trying to mind control him highlighted with sharp red lighting contrasting with Chris and Rob almost always being lit with cooler blue lights to show their resistance. These tone fluxuate throughout the scene as Chris is initially being controlled warmer lights and red tones are boosted in post production to represent his indoctrination, the opposite is also true as later in the scene when Chris is escaping blue tones slowly get more prominent as shots flip from warm tones to cooler lighting eventually climaxing in the final shots when Rob comes to rescue Chris and little to no red tones are remaining. These effects are created with the use of diffused coloured bulbs to convey mood whilst still leaving shots with dark contrast, this is used in unison with harsh colour grading to boost vibrant tones and adjust warm tones without having to the cut shots short.
