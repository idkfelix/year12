# Theory
- **General Journal:** an Accounting record used to analyse and record each transaction, and to identify its source document before posting to the General Ledger
- **Correcting Entries** 
	1. write the error out
	2. write the correct entries
	3. leave anything that's the same in both
	4. reverse entries that shouldn't have been recorded (errors)
	5. make entries that haven't been done (omitted correct)
