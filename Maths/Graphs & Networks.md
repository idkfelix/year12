# Basics
- **Vertex**: an object represented by a point on the graph
- **Edge**: an edge is a connection between two vertices represented by a line
- **Loop**: a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself
- **Graph**: a graph is a collection of vertices that may be connected to each other using edges is a specific way
- **Degree**: the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to itself. A *loop* counts as 2 edges for the degree of the vertex
# Types of Graphs
- **Undirected**: a graph where the edges between vertices work in both directions
- **Directed**: a graph in which edges only work in one direction, making some vertices unreachable for other vertices.
- **Simple**: a simple graph has no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices. Each vertex has a degree of at most $\large n-1$ .
- **Complete**: a complete graph
