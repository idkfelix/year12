## Development Model Overview
The development model I chose for this project consisted of a traditional waterfall model with nested sprints in the design and development stages of the waterfall. This project effectively required the use of a waterfall model to meet assessment dates not possible with a spiral or agile development model due to their core focus on iterative design. The use of this model did suffer restrictions regarding the modification of project scope or requirements as waterfall development features large amounts of planning in the initial evaluation to boost efficiency throughout the project, however due to the fast changing nature of modern software development this proved counter productive throughout the development of my software solution as the clients requirements changed. Thankfully the proactive implementation of sprints throughout the design and development stages, split into three scopes of implementation identified in the initial client meetings, allowed for the required reduction in scope to the project by removing sprints, albeit still creating large unplanned modifications to the production timeline. Reflecting on this pitfall of the development model it can be seen the potential loss in effectiveness as the client received a software solution missing proposed requirements
