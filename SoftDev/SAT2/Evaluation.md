## Evaluation Strategy
To evaluate my software solution I will create create various criteria tables for myself, the client and user testing participants, corresponding to the the chosen development model's efficiency and effectiveness in production, the implementation's usability within its intended environment, and its satisfaction of the clients functional and non-functional requirements. This evaluation will be conducted over two weeks in individual sessions with the user participants to document user satisfaction and a meeting with the client to discuss the outcome of the project and the satisfactory completion of its requirements. Additionally I will conduct further evaluation of the software and its data management to document its practical efficiency and effectiveness.
