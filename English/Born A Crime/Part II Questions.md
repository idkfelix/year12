## Chapter 11: _Outsider_

> 10. Read the following excerpt in which Noah describes the cliques and groups that formed during lunch break at his high school, Sandringham High:
> 
   > _South African schools don’t have cafeterias. At Sandringham we’d buy our lunch at what we call the tuck shop, a little canteen, and then have free rein to go wherever we wanted on the school grounds to eat—the quad, the courtyard, the playground, wherever. Kids would break off and cluster into their cliques and groups. People were still grouped by colour in most cases, but you could see how they all blended and shaded into one another. The kids who played soccer were mostly black. The kids who played tennis were mostly white. The kids who played cricket were a mix. The Chinese kids would hang out next to the prefab buildings. The matrics, what South Africans call seniors, would hang out on the quad. The popular, pretty girls would hang out over here, and computer geeks would hang out over there. To the extent that the groupings were racial, it was because of the ways race overlapped class and geography out in the real world. Suburban kids hung out with suburban kids. Township kids hung out with township kids._
   > 
> What similarities or differences have you observed during lunchtime at Mullauna College?

> 11.  _Ever the outsider, I created my own strange little world_. What _world_ did Noah create and how did this operate?

> 13. Noah often clarifies South African practices or concepts by comparing them to American references and some of his humour is clearly for an American audience. Find three examples of this from this chapter.

## Chapter 13: _Prelude_

>

> b) When Teddy was caught, should Noah have admitted his guilt as well? Why/Why not?

> 18. Read the following excerpt from the end of this chapter:
> 
  > _I kept waiting for it to be a trick, for them to turn and say, “It’s you!” They didn’t. At a certain point, I felt so invisible I almost wanted to take credit. I wanted to jump up and point at the TV and say, “Are you people blind?! That’s me! Can you not see that that’s me?!” But of course I didn’t. And they couldn’t. These people had been so fucked by their own construct of race that they could not see that the white person they were looking for was sitting right in front of them._
  > 
  >  _Eventually they sent me back to class. I spent the rest of the day and the next couple of weeks waiting for the other shoe to drop, waiting for my mum to get the call. “We’ve got him! We figured it out!” But the call never came._
  >  
> Explain what Noah means by “_their own construct of race”._

## Chapter 14: _A young man’s long, awkward, occasionally tragic, and frequently humiliating education in affairs of the heart, Part III: The Dance_

> 19. In what way does Noah’s experience with Babiki symbolise his hubris?

> 20. How does this experience with Babiki reinforce Noah’s comment in the prelude to Chapter 4, that “_Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says, “We’re the same.” A language barrier says, “We’re different.”_
