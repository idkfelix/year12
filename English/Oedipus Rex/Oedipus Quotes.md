## Hubris and tragic flaw

- He thinks he can outrun his own fate which inevitably leads to it happening 
- “You pray to the gods, let me grant your prayers.” Oedipus believes he can grant the prayers given to the gods proving he thinks he is as powerful as the gods 
- “The world knows my fame: I am Oedipus” 
- “I'll bring it all to light myself!” - Oedipus shows he will be the one to save the city 
## Chorus response throughout
Parados:  
- grief on grief, no end— too much to bear, we are all dying O my people . . . 
- I worship you in dread . . . what now, what is your price? 175 some new sacrifice? some ancient rite from the past come round again each spring?
- so many deaths, numberless deaths on deaths, no end— Thebes is dying, look, her children stripped of pity

The chorus begs the gods for answers to the suffering of Thebes “Apollo, Healer of Delos I worship you in dread . . . what now, what is your price?”. They go into great detail describing the suffering of Thebes, “so many deaths, numberless deaths on deaths, no end— 205 Thebes is dying, look, her children stripped of pity”

Ode 1:
- The horror too dark to tell, 530 whose ruthless bloody hands have done the work?
Exodus: 
- 1678-1680“People of Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus. He solved the famous riddle with his brilliance, he rose to power, a man beyond all power”(The Chorus addressing the people of Thebes and comparing their once great King Oedipus to the man he currently is.”
- “Who could behold his greatness without envy? “( Referring to the greatness and accomplishments of Oedipus and how while he is revered by his people he is also envied by them. As well as dramatic irony in the fact that Creon the man who didn’t envy Oedipus' power and wealth is the one who ends up with it.)
- “Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him”(Acknowledging the fall of Oedipus as now he drowns in a sea of agony for his own creation. Also a callback to the Boat metaphor in the Parados contrasting his previous image and current)
- “Now as we keep our watch and wait the final day, count no man happy till he dies, free of pain at last.”(Stating that Oedipus will only be able to be happy after he dies to be freed from his agony and how the people of Thebes are waiting for him to be freed.

## Sophocles authorial intent
Play is crucial for reinforcing power of God’s – Written at a time where society of ancient Greece started to question the sovereignty/divinity of God. Why Sophocles' exalted the powers of God’s and the overarching theme of divine destiny and emptiness of human efforts. 
- Written at a time of “intellectual revolution”
-  Fagles notes that “Sophocles was dealing with matters that had urgent contemporary significance; prophecy was one of the great controversial questions of the day.”
This emphasis gives the “age-old story” a contemporary significance, enhancing the fear and pity the play mongers.
- Sophocles’ contemporary portrayal aligns his audience to experience the tragedy themselves. “The catastrophe of the tragic hero thus becomes the catastrophe of fifth-century man.
- Oedipus is the typical Athenian man – the audience are positioned to see themselves in Oedipus himself. “Epitome of the Athenian character”
- Sophecles portrays Oedipus as the epitomised Athenian, enahcing the tragic fall, leaving lasting effects on his audience.
- Sophocles intends to put forward Oedipus as an admirable Athenian man, in order to make his downfall all the more tragic, and for the contemporary audience to see themselves as him. “His destiny moves us only because it might have been ours” 
Simple terms : Sophocles intends to bring the contemporary audiences attention and respect back to the Gods as it was faltering. He does this through inflicting fear in the audience of the consequences which is displayed through Oedipus. 
## Pursuit of truth
- (went to prophet) “I have a terrible fear the blind seer can see” – Oedipus 
- “You with your precious eyes, you’re blind to the corruption of your life” -Tiresias
- “Stop—in the name of god, if you love your own life, call off this search! My suffering is enough.” – Jocasta
- (Oedipus tries to evade the god’s prophecy) “you cannot equal the gods” - Priest 
- No skill in the world, nothing human can penetrate the future.
- “None of your power follows you through life” -Creon 
## Denial and fear (Sarah and Esha)
- “Stop—in the name of god, if you love your own life, call off this search!” - Jocasta 
- “I am afraid, Jocasta” - Oedipus
- “It’s all chance, chance rules out lives” - Jocasta → Jocasta’s dismisses the Gods out of fear,,.  , . ,
- “So much for prophecy. Its neither here nor there” - Jocasta (out of fear of revealing the truth)
- “They’re nothing, worthless” - Jocasta when convincing Oedipus not to listen to the gods, out of fear of revealing the truth”
- When oedipus fled corinth out of fear of the prophecy, it lead him to his real mother and thus his downfall
- Oedipus denies the prophecies he hears, not out of fear but “becasue of his pride and his anger. Jocasta, in denial, tells him to ignore it, despite having an inkling to the reality and tragedy. 
- Jocasta chooses to stay in denial out of fear of the agony it will cause 
## Pragmatism and loyalty - Creon
- Creon speaks more formally than the other characters
	- “Are you quite finished?”  - Creon (Contrasting Oedipus’ rage with Creon’s stability)
	- “I don’t know, and when I don’t, I keep quiet.” - Creon to Oedipus
- Chorus starts with unwavering loyalty towards Oedipus, then turns into questioning his behaviour, then pitying him and learning a lesson from him.
	- “Still the king, the master of all things? No more” - Creon almost breaking his loyalty to Oedipus as he is the new king
	- “Not I. Only the gods can give you that” Creon still views the gods as above everyone, reflecting his loyalty to the gods and his intelligence
	- “Our leader, my lord, was once a man named Laius.” - Creon continues to mention Laius as though he still holds the king's title even as he is dead. 
- Creon allows Oedipus to be with his children one last time, despite him accusing him of murder (“I know the joy they gave you all these years”) 
	-  “Apollo commands us—he was quite clear—‘Drive the corruption from the land, don’t harbour it any longer, past all cure, don’t nurse it in your soil—root it out!’” Creon delivers the Oracle’s message, showing his role as a dutiful messenger and adviser.
	- “I haven’t come to mock you, Oedipus, or to criticise your former failings.” (Creon to Oedipus) Creon takes over as the ruler of Thebes, showing his sense of responsibility and leadership - emphasises his loyalty to the people and his sensibility in not making a fool out of Oedipus due to his faults. 
## Irony and dramatic irony
- Tiresias saying, “You see and still are blind,” means that he knows that Oedipus can literally see, but he is ‘blind’ to the fact that he is the murderer of Laius, but Oedipus is far too convinced it is someone else that he doesn’t realise it.
- "As to the killer, slipping off a long or with a band of men, I now call down a life to fit a life dragged out in degradation. And if I myself should prove myself to have him in my halls an intimate, then on myself I call down every curse I've just invoked."
- “ i know him by hearsay, i have not seen him”
- “I pity you. I see-how could I fail to see” - Oedipus (70) He still cannot see. 
- “Drive the corruption from the land” - Creon (119) Oedipus is the corruption
- “If he were my father” - Oedipus (301) Searching for Laius killer
- “Let no crops grow out of the earth for them” - Oedipus (308) He has children with Jocasta
- “You, plotting to kill me, kill the king” - Oedipus referring to Creon (597) Oedipus killed the king
- “The pains we inflict upon ourselves hurt most of all” - Messenger (1361) Jocasta killed herself and Oedipus deepens his pain. .
## Role of Gods and Fate
- Prophecies and oracles
	- 1036 - You prophecies of the gods, where are you now? - (Jocasta is challenging the gods by saying this)
	- 1064 - They’re nothing, worthless. - referring to the prophecies
	- 1069 - It’s all chance, chance rules our lives. - Jocasta (Jocasta’s dismisses the Gods)
- The will of the gods
	- 291 - Even if god had never urged you on to act, how could you leave the crime uncleaned so long? - Oedipus to Thebans (Oedipus telling people to disobey the gods for his sake) 
	- 799 - Whatever the god needs and seeks he’ll bring to light himself, with ease. (shes questioning the oracle and prophets as it didn't come directly from the gods)
- Divine judgement and punishment
	- 1008 - I come with prayers and offerings . . . I beg you, cleanse us, set us free of defilement! - Jocasta
- The gods impose crisis upon the characters in the play as a test of characters, in turn bring out their worst traits / qualities from each character that define their actions throughout the play.
- Failure of character in times of judgement (pride, ignorance, denial) leads to punishment from the gods in the form of revelation to the character's worsening fate that ultimately leads to the compulsion to debilitate or end the life of oneself.
- The oracles entice stark reactions from the characters of the play that clearly highlight their pitfalls and personal flaws in light of the prophecy sent from the gods, whether it be denial, rationality or anger.
## Foreshadowing and omens
- Oedipus declares to the public that he himself is “a stranger to the story of Laius’ murder as stranger to the deed”. This foreshadows, for modern audiences, that all is not as it seems.
- Oedipus tells Tiresias that he is “blind in mind and ears as well as eyes”
