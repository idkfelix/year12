On a recent podcast, "Garment Gab", presented as the "podcast for those who seek informed views on pressing issues in the textile industry", Dr Gabrielle Grey discusses the current topical issues of fast fashion, its impacts and potential reforms consumers can take to reduce their effect. Dr Grey adopts an authoritative tone throughout the podcast often using statistics to present herself as an expert on the topic. Throughout the podcast Dr Grey discusses the environmental and ethical sacrifices made in the fast fashion industry, but also the benefits for the global economy and fashion industry whilst providing commentary on the pressing issues and potential solutions.

Dr Grey's primary argument opposing the fast fashion industry, its devastating environmental impact, is presented to the listener as a series of hyperboles and metaphors to produce descriptive imagery of the industries destruction alongside various statistics that reinforce her authority as an expert on the subject. Dr Grey initialises her argument providing statistics from a named source that reveals the sheer enormous scale of garment production in the fast fashion industry, even reiterating the billion in the statistic to emphasis its weight. This is followed by a series of metaphors to assist listeners in visualising the environmental destruction caused by this mass production, this imagery additionally serves to sensationalise the devastating effects discussed to draw in the listener before leading to additional key statistics.
