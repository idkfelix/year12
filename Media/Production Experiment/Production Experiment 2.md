# Intention
My Second production experiment will be to explore the use of in camera setting to achieve a stylised aesthetic similar to that found in popular film and skate videos, translated in a zine format. This will be done by experimenting with the cameras ND filter, white balance, 'colour temp', 'detail level' and 'chroma level'. The goal of this experiment is to learn and apply techniques when taking my photographs to enhance the aesthetic and explore potential styles for my final media product.

I will conduct this experiment by shooting various photographs adjusting my cameras settings and documenting the settings used for each photo. To get the most variation out of my camera I will combine various setting for each shot in order to create a distinct style for the final photographs. I will conclude my experiment by analysing each photograph and discussing the benefits of the settings used.

For my first photograph I set my colour balance to -3, ND filter to off and detail level to 1 which produced a blown out cool colour effect over the whole image, this is especially noticeable when looking at the white tones across the shot, this style of photo looks quite amateur and I will avoid creating this effect in my final product by using the appropriate ND filter setting in bright environments and opting for a more neutral colour balance that can then be manipulated in post-production

My camera setup for the second photograph used contrasting settings to the first image by adjusting the ND filter to be set at 1/8, colour balance +3 and detail level to 5. This style of photography is more appealing to me, however the increased sharpness of the image is very harsh and does not suit the aesthetic of zine that I aim to produce. Despite the pitfalls of this setting profile I do like the saturated colour pallet and believe this is suited to my production as I aim to convey emotion through the use of traditional colour techniques.

My final photograph was taken with almost neutral camera settings, except for a cooler white balance and 'detail level' of 3, this profile offers a cleaner image that can be manipulated in post-production with colour grading techniques. Although this photograph is taken with neutral settings in mind it is important to note that the camera used to take all of my photos uses a 3CCD imaging system that is notorious for producing images with a grainy or dirty look. This choice of camera (Panasonic HVX200) is deliberate as it has been used almost exclusively when producing skateboarding films over the last two decades since its release and after my experimentation I will utilise its distinct style to replicate that familiar look in my final product.
