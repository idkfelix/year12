# Audience Feedback
## Is the narrative coherent?
> I think your narrative and the storyline's progression is relatively clear, but the act annotations would make it easier for audiences to understand.

> It’s really clear - especially laid out in order like they were, I didn’t have any trouble understanding the narrative.

> Yes, it makes a lot of sense viewing it like this and I think that you’ve done a great job adhering to your narrative statement that you described.

> For a collection of photos, I think it clearly and coherently show's us your narrative in a way that's easy to follow.

> It's clear that the protagonist gets obsessed with skateboarding and is doing all he can to improve, just not entirely sure if it's clear that it's an obsession, maybe if you made it clear that he's ignoring his friend by showing that there's a ton of missed notifications or something along those lines, again that's up to you.

> I understand that a guy goes into a store, buys a skateboard, does some tricks and injuries himself. I think if you want to make it his obsessiveness with skateboard maybe implement a few photos that explain that. Like the phone photo could have a bunch of messages missed or something like that

> It was clear after you told the narrative but without that information it is a bit unclear - so the annotations you mentioned would be added hopefully will help with that.

> For the most part its pretty coherent, its a bit unclear that he is neglecting his friends. maybe more shots of him receiving notifications and ignoring it.

> Sort of?? It's not really that clear, but the images link together if that makes sense. Your story is shown, but you need an in-depth explanation of what is happening.
