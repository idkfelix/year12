Students and fellow protestors, I stand here today in remembrance of those in out group who have fallen to the corrupt governments disgraceful massacre at Tiananmen square over the past week. Out fight is no yet over despite the best efforts of corrupt politicians to censor our cause through intimidation, violence and illegal searches to track down fellow leaders, such as myself. Those of us who perished in the square will forever be a beacon of hope across the world of centuries to come as in the face of atrocious violence they stood in protest to fight the corruption that plagues our country and advocate against the nations disgraceful censorship for the benefit of our people.

We protested peacefully with pure intent to advocate a better life for all Chinese people as we move further and further from the fall of Mao Zedong and the terror inflicted on our people. We pushed for the funding of our and future generations education to breed opportunity throughout the country. We fought for the privatisation of news and media so the Chinese people can stay informed and here the true stories of those suffering across the country. We tirelessly advocated reforms to our tyrannical leadership so to finally put a stop to the endless corruption we've witnessed throughout the "government" and its devastating effects upon the nations citizens. We stood as a beacon of hope across the country, yet the government responded with a violent campaign to turn us into a tombstone.

The horrendous violence the unleashed upon us stands as a testament to the great movement of change we have enacted, and to the tyrants who wish to exterminate us I say, 'You may tred us in the very dirt, but still, like dust, we'll rise'. As the tanks rolled through the square many a courageous protestor fought back in an impossible stand, not to inflict harm or create divide, but to create hope for all those aligned with out cause and for years to come let that hope drive our fight as we push back on the crushing rule of our counties leaders. We now must fight back against the violent censorship they are imposing on our story of hope, we must spread our tale of the malicious massacre we were so luck to survive far and wide so to it is not lost to time and for centuries to come we will remember the despicable actions our government perpetuated against their own people.

 Across the world our story and the memory of those less fortunate must be honoured in history as a beacon of hope as to overshadow the devastating actions of our once great nations corrupt government and stand to inspire the future generations .
