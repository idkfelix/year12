## Development Model Overview
The development model I chose for this project consisted of a traditional waterfall model with nested sprints in the design and development stages of the waterfall. This project effectively required the use of a waterfall model to meet assessment dates not possible with a spiral or agile development model due to their core focus on iterative design. The use of this model did suffer restrictions regarding the modification of project scope or requirements as waterfall development features large amounts of planning in the initial evaluation
